# Why i made This?

While trying out the chatbot application, I thought about whether it would be possible to connect it to my Slack or chatGPT, utilizing the UI and functionalities as they are.

Typically, communication with authors on platforms like blogs has been through non-real-time methods such as "email" or "comments."

I found the idea of having a chatbot application connected to my Slack very convenient, so I decided to develop it myself, leveraging the existing UI and features.
